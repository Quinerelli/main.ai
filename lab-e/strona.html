            <p>
                The Hobbit is set in Middle-earth and follows home-loving Bilbo Baggins,
                the hobbit of the title, who joins the wizard Gandalf and the thirteen
                dwarves of Thorin's Company, on a quest to reclaim the dwarves' home and
                treasure from the dragon Smaug. Bilbo's journey takes him from his peaceful
                rural surroundings into more sinister territory. The story is told in the
                form of a picaresque or episodic quest; several chapters introduce a new
                type of monster or threat as Bilbo progresses through the landscape. Bilbo
                gains a new level of maturity, competence, and wisdom by accepting the disreputable,
                romantic, fey, and adventurous sides of his nature and applying his wits and common
                sense. The story reaches its climax in the Battle of Five Armies, where many of the
                characters and creatures from earlier chapters re-emerge to engage in conflict.

                <li>The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey</li>
                <p>A well mannered Hobbit named Bilbo Baggins, embarks upon a journey
                    to take back a kingdom, and a very important jewel, with twelve dwarves,
                    and a wizard named Gandalf the Grey. Halfway throughout the journey, Bilbo
                    embarks upon a magic golden ring, which he stole, or earned from Gollum.</p>

                <li>The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug</li>
                <p>This part continues the adventure of the title
                    character Bilbo Baggins as he journeys with the Wizard Gandalf and thirteen
                    Dwarves, led by Thorin Oakenshield, on an epic quest to reclaim the Lonely
                    Mountain and the lost Dwarf Kingdom of Erebor.</p>

                <p>Having survived the beginning of their unexpected journey, the Company continues
                    East, encountering along the way the skin-changer Beorn and a swarm of giant
                    Spiders in the treacherous forest of Mirkwood. After escaping capture by the
                    dangerous Wood-elves, the Dwarves journey to Lake-town, and finally to the Lonely
                    Mountain itself, where they must face the greatest danger of all — a creature more
                    terrifying than any other; one which will test not only the depth of their courage but
                    the limits of their friendship and the wisdom of the journey itself — the Dragon Smaug.</p>

                <li>The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies</li>
                <p>Bilbo Baggins and company are forced to engage in a war against an array
                    of combatants and keep the Lonely Mountain from falling into the hands of
                    a rising darkness. After the Dragon leaves the Lonely Mountain, the people
                    of Lake-town see a threat coming. Orcs, dwarves, elves and people prepare for war.</p>

                <p><strong>Bilbo Baggins</strong></p>
                <p>A quiet and unassuming hobbit from the Shire, Bilbo Baggins is thrust into a grand adventure when Gandalf the Grey convinces him to join a group of dwarves on a quest to reclaim their homeland from the dragon Smaug. Though initially reluctant and more concerned with his comfortable home life, Bilbo proves himself to be resourceful and brave, finding courage within himself as he outwits trolls, spiders, and even Gollum. His discovery of the One Ring during the journey significantly impacts the future of Middle-earth.</p>

                <p>Gollum, once known as Sméagol, is a twisted, corrupted creature driven mad by the power of the One Ring, which he calls "my precious." He has lived in isolation beneath the Misty Mountains for centuries, surviving on raw fish and the occasional unfortunate trespasser. When Bilbo encounters him, Gollum's cunning and dangerous nature emerge as they engage in a deadly game of riddles, with the Ring as the prize. Gollum's obsession with the Ring and his dual personalities reflect his inner torment and the Ring's corruptive power.</p>

Known for his sharp eyesight, lightning-fast reflexes, and incredible agility, Legolas is a fearsome warrior. Although he does not appear in Tolkien's original "The Hobbit" novel, his role in Peter Jackson's film adaptations showcases his loyalty to his father and his complex relationships with other characters, particularly the dwarves. His nobility and skill make him a key figure in defending his people and the land from the growing darkness in Middle-earth.</p>

                <p>A fierce and independent elf warrior, Tauriel serves as the captain of the Woodland Realm’s guard under King Thranduil. Although not present in the original book, Tauriel's character was introduced in the film adaptations to add depth to the story. She is brave and compassionate, showing great skill in battle as well as a defiance against the isolationist policies of her king. Her romantic tension with the dwarf Kili further complicates the elvish-dwarvish relationships in the films, highlighting her open-mindedness and emotional complexity.</p>

                <p>Smaug is an enormous, fire-breathing dragon who took over the Lonely Mountain and its treasure from the dwarves many years before the events of "The Hobbit." He is cunning, arrogant, and supremely confident in his power, considering himself invulnerable. His greed is immense, as he hoards the vast wealth of Erebor, including the prized Arkenstone. Smaug's interactions with Bilbo showcase his intelligence and vanity, as he toys with the hobbit before realizing the potential threat he represents. His destruction of Lake-town and his eventual downfall highlight the devastating consequences of unchecked power and greed.</p>
